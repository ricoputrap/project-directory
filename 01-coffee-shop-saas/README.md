## D. Suggested Approach for Development

1. **Modular and Scalable Design**:
   - Focus on a modular architecture to simplify potential decoupling of unified systems as needs evolve.
   
2. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - Implement flexible RBAC within the unified application for distinct access control across user roles.

3. **Deployment and Monitoring Infrastructure**:
   - Utilize cloud services for scalability and availability, with monitoring tools for performance insights.

4. **Iterative Development in Phases**:
   - Employ Agile methodologies to ensure nimble development, adjustments, and enhancements based on user feedback.

5. **Training and Support**:
   - Develop comprehensive training materials and support options to facilitate user adoption across all systems.

By addressing both customer-facing and administrative needs, the proposed solution provides a cohesive, scalable, and efficient path to digital transformation for coffee shop operations across multiple tenants.
